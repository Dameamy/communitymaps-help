## Let's start discussing!

Each contribution has a comments section where everyone can discuss it. Comments are hierarchical, and they are represented with different colours:

* ***Green*** - your personal comments.
* ***Blue*** - parent comment of a hierarchy (unless the comment is yours).
* ***Yellow*** - responds to comments.

There are also ***orange*** comments. They indicate reports.

## What are reports?

When something is not right with a contribution, everyone has the right to inform administrators and moderators of the project about the issues. Contributions are still visible to the public, but can be suspended until all the issues have been resolved.
