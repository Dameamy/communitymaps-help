## Edit contribution

You can edit your own contributions (or all contributions, if you’re a moderator of the project), at any time.

![Added contribution to the project](/images/en/added-contribution.png)

When editing a contribution, you can change its shape, move its location, and change, add or remove all its text information. The selected category cannot be changed and always stays the same.

---

## Delete contribution

Deletion of personal contributions is also available.

![Confirmation message for deleting a contribution](/images/en/delete-contribution-confirmation.png)

Once deleted, contributions **cannot** be recovered. All media files and comments associated with each contribution are deleted too.

---

## Delete media files

Every added picture or video can be deleted by the creator of a contribution, or moderator of the whole project.

---

## Delete comments

Every comment can be deleted. You can delete either your personal comments from any contribution, or any comment from your contributions. Comments that have reports in their hierarchy cannot be deleted while the issue is not closed.
