## What can be uploaded?

Every contribution can have pictures and videos attached to it. They can be viewed by anyone who has access to contributions, but only the creator of that contribution and moderators can add new media.

This additional data can be uploaded either while adding a new contribution, or when the contribution has already been added to the project. Also, any media can be removed from the contribution.

## Let's upload!

Multiple media files can be selected either manually, or by dragging and dropping them on the drop area (modern desktop browsers only).

Before the file is uploaded to our servers, it is added to a list of new files. You can change the name of a file, and add an optional description. Each file can then be uploaded individually or all together.

### Pictures

Uploaded pictures appear on the list of media files straight away. They can be viewed when accessing the contribution’s media tab.

The creator of a contribution or moderator of the whole project can delete uploaded pictures at any time. Once deleted, pictures cannot be recovered.

### Videos

Videos take time to process. Even though they are visible on the list of media files together with uploaded pictures, they are not accessible straight away.
