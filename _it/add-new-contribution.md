## Can I contribute?

If project’s settings allow it, every person accessing it can be a contributor. Sometimes administrators of a project can restrict contributing either to registered users or only to some specific users.

## Let's contribute!

### Step 1: Drawing a shape

The first step when adding a new contribution is to draw the shape of it on the map: it can either be a [point](#points), a [line](#lines), or an [area](#areas) - whichever best represents current information. Only one shape can be drawn for each contribution.

Please note that the drawn shape **can** be changed and edited once a contribution has been added to the project.

#### Points

Points are used for mapping single spots, such as bus stops or monuments. They are placed with a single mouse click anywhere on the map.

#### Lines

Lines are used for mapping paths, roads, etc. They are drawn by adding points alongside the path, and finished with a mouse click on the last point. Points are connected together automatically to form a single line.

#### Areas

Areas are used for mapping bigger objects, such as buildings, parks, lakes. They are drawn by adding points around an object, and finished with a mouse click on the first point. Points are connected together automatically and the object is filled in with a colour to form an area.

### Step 2: Choosing a category

We already know that every contribution belongs to a category, so the second step is to choose one for a new contribution. The list of categories shows all active categories that can be used and how many fields have been added to each category.

When a category is selected, all the fields of that category are loaded to the form.

Please note that the chosen category **cannot** be changed once a contribution has been added to the project.

### Step 3: Completing a form

On the last step, a form must be filled in.

All the required fields can *only* be left empty if a contribution is saved as a draft. Otherwise a notification is displayed and the required field is highlighted.

There can be different fields on a form: text field, number field, single lookup and multiple lookup fields, also date and time fields. Appropriate information *must be* provided for each field, otherwise a notification is displayed and the field is highlighted.

Anonymous users can only add contributions to the project, but registered users are allowed to save it as a draft. Draft contributions can be finished and added to the project later.

Please note that media files **can** be added either during the contributing process or when the contribution has been added to the project.
